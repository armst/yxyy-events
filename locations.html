        <h4>The Commune &mdash; large, light-filled, indoor, air conditioned space near the quiet pool.</h4>
        <p>Talks, workouts, yoga, and any all-community indoor events will take place here. The rest of the time, that space will have tables & chairs available for smaller sessions and gatherings. Very likely, multiple smaller sessions will be going on here at once as it's one of the few large, air conditioned spaces.</p>

        <h4>The Commune Pool &mdash; the quieter of the two pools.</h4>
        <p>There'll be DJs here during the day from 10am-6pm but they know to keep it on the chill side. This pool closes at 2 a.m. There's some lounging areas around this pool but not a ton of lounge chairs.</p>

        <h4>The Commune Lawn &mdash; near the Commune & Commune Pool.</h4>
        <p>Outdoor space for lounging in the sun and shade.</p>

        <h4>The Moroccan Patio &mdash; shaded outdoor space w/ table & chairs between the Amigo Room (indoor bar) and the main pool.</h4>
        <p>Great for small conversation-based sessions and games if you don't mind the heat. Keep in mind that there will be amplified DJ music (thanks to our YxYY volunteer DJs) out there during the day.</p>

        <h4>The Main Pool &mdash; the party pool & giant hot tub.</h4>
        <p>There'll be DJs here during the day from 10am-6pm. It'll stay open until 4a.m. Plenty of lounge chairs, small tables, and sun shades.</p>

        <h4>The Amigo Room &mdash; dark, indoor, air-conditioned bar.</h4>
        <p>There is a house-system that ipods, ipads & laptops can hook up to for music. There will be YxYY DJs in here Friday & Sunday nights. </p>

        <h4>The Co-op &mdash; smaller, light-filled indoor, air conditioned space right off the Moroccan patio</h4>
        <p>This will be set up as the Maker Lounge all weekend. Chock full of fun toys like a MakerBot, a Cricut, and OtherMill and more....</p>

        <h4>The Clubhouse, first floor & second floor &mdash; new indoor space this year! Two levels, 4000 sq feet, indoor, air conditioned building with outdoor private patio off the ground floor & veranda off the top floor.</h4>
        <p>This will be another space for activities, sessions, game-playing. Talk to Amy if you have something in mind that you think would really make great use of this space.</p>

        <h4>Stargazing Deck &mdash; overlooking the main pool & Moroccan Patio</h4>
        <p>Small deck with lounge chairs and small tables. Not covered other than possibly some shade  umbrellas. Lovely at night.</p>

        <h4>Various fireplaces &mdash; scattered about the property.</h4>
        <p>There are gas fire places with seating scattered around the property near the rooms. Great for smaller conversations & meet-ups.</p>

        <h4>Your own rooms or patios</h4>
